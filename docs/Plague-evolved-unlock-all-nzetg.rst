Step 2: Start in South Africa. Is it possible to unlock all the cheats and and plague types and all that stuff without doing anything? Maybe I could use Cheat Engine to. In order to unlock this, you MUST complete the Simian Flu AND Shadow Plague on normal, as well. This did not unlock upon winning all the base game plague types.

 · Description: Unlock the cheats by winning a game on Brutal for ALL disease types As the description: Immune Strain, Hidden Strain, Unlimited Strain and Turbo Strain will be unlocked after you have beaten the game on Brutal for all disease types. Description: Publish a Plague Inc: Evolved Scenario to Steam Workshop Pretty self-explanatory. Upon reaching the main menu, press "Load Game" Load the game where you are about to win. Win! Unlock another new Gene! Repeat steps 5 through 7 until you run out of Genes to unlock. This has been tested on Bacteria, Normal Difficulty. It works with the other virus types that have their own custom sets of genes. This still works as of 4/28/  · Link with all disease types unloacked: +Inc+"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section of the Cop.
