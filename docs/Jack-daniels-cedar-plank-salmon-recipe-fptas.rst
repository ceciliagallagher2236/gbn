Soak cedar planks in salted water for at least 2 hours. Step 4: Grilling salmon on a cedar plank takes a little longer than grilling fish normally takes as the wet plank absorbs much of the heat initially. Also, the lower F temperature helps prevent the plank from burning entirely before the fish is cooked! After 15 - 20 minutes check on the fish.
